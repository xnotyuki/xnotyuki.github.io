<p><u>Part 1</u></p>
<img src="/2021/06/17/Trey-Birthday-SSR-Personal/bg1.png" class="">

<p><b>NRC School Newsletter<br>Special Edition: Birthday Boy Interview<br>Trey</b></p>
<p>Happy Birthday</p>
<p>Trey: Oh, Yuu. Did you come all this way to celebrate? Thank you.</p>
<p>Since it’s your birthday, how do you feel today?</p>
<p>T: It’s the same as usual. I told them that they didn’t have to throw a huge party like this for the third year in a row, and yet…</p>
<p>T: Once again, it became quite the lively birthday party.</p>
<p>T: I’m sure there are some who only see this as an opportunity to mess around</p>
<p>T: But well, I’m still grateful that they came by to celebrate regardless. I’ll try to have fun.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular that you would like?</p>
<p>T: Are you getting something for me? In that case…</p>
<p>T: I want 10,000 Madol per 100 grams worth of high-grade vanilla beans.</p>
<p>S-so expensive…<br>I will think it over…</p>
<p>T: Hahaha. I was just kidding.</p>
<p>T: I was asked the same question by the rest of the dorm about a month ago.</p>
<p>T: I answered them like I did just now but… I didn’t expect them to take it so seriously.</p>
<p>How exactly did you answer them?</p>
<p>T: For Cater, I told him to “Make the Unbirthday cakes in my place for half a year!”</p>
<p>T: For Deuce, I asked him to “Grow the ingredients I need for making sweets in the botanical gardens for me.”</p>
<p>T: As for Ace, “Help me to maintain my broom for Flying classes.” And finally for Riddle, I said that “I want concise revision notes for my next test.”</p>
<p>T: …I pretty much answered them like that.</p>
<p>How did everyone respond?</p>
<p>T: Some protested, others were shocked, but eventually everyone simply nodded and said they “Got it”.</p>
<p>T: I didn’t think they would take what I said to them so seriously.</p>
<p>In other words… Everything you told them was simply made in jest?</p>
<p>T: Well, of course. Why would it not be? I did tell them I was just joking, afterall.</p>
<p><u>Part 2</u></p>
<p>Aside from making sweets, are you good at cooking meals as well?</p>
<p>T: Yeah, during times when my parents were busy tending to the cake shop, I would often be in charge of making dinner.</p>
<p>T: I would try making a variety of different dishes so that we wouldn’t grow bored of eating the same few meals everyday. Thanks to that, I can pretty much cook anything I want.</p>
<p>What would you say is your signature dish?</p>
<p>T: Hm… It would probably be hamburg steak. My younger siblings would ask for it a lot, so I’d end up making it pretty regularly.</p>
<p>T: My hamburg steak is pretty delicious, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>T: To bring out the best flavour, you can’t beat using Walrus brand oyster sauce as a secret ingredient, and…</p>
<p>…You know you can’t fool me with that lie anymore, right?</p>
<p>T: Haha! Sure, it may certainly have been a joke when we were making mont blanc, but it’s different this time.</p>
<p>T: Oyster sauce is well known for being a seasoning to give meat dishes a richer flavour.</p>
<p>T: Plus, adding an egg, sunny side up with a runny yolk on top is a Clover family specialty. If you mix the piping hot gravy together with the yolk…</p>
<p>T: …Now, try to imagine it.</p>
<p>Gulp…</p>
<p>T: …You look like you’re starving. Okay, okay. I’ll make some for you too next time.</p>
<p>By the way, have you ever failed at cooking?</p>
<p>T: Of course I have. While I may have some talent at making sweets, I’m relatively bad in other areas of cooking.</p>
<p>T: But thankfully for me, even if the end product comes out inedible, the rest of the dorm will still eat it without complaint.</p>
<p>But, why?</p>
<p>T: Fufu… Have you forgotten what my Unique Magic can do?</p>
<p>Wait, don’t tell me, you used ‘Doodle Suit’ to change the flavour?</p>
<p>T: I’m kidding, of course I wouldn’t do something like that… most of the time.</p>
<p><u>Part 3</u></p>
<p>What is your favourite food?</p>
<p>T: It’s Candied Violets.</p>
<p>How did you find out that you liked them?</p>
<p>T: If I remember correctly, the first time I tried them was before I entered elementary school.</p>
<p>T: I probably grew so attached to them because I was impressed that edible flowers existed.</p>
<p>T: From that point onwards, I would try to eat any wild flowers I could find growing by the roadside. I can only imagine the amount of trouble I must have caused my parents.</p>
<p>T: Although I personally can’t recall all that much…</p>
<p>The Candied Violets must have been that good.</p>
<p>T: Definitely. I liked the flavour a lot, but that’s not all…</p>
<p>T: When I ate them, it would feel like I was lying in a field of flowers. I also really enjoyed how the floral taste of the violets would spread throughout my mouth.</p>
<p>T: I would get so lost in their flavour, there were times where I would overeat because I’d lose track of how many I had eaten.</p>
<p>T: Especially since my family stocked a lot of Candied Violets to use as cake ingredients,</p>
<p>T: I would get scolded by my parents constantly because I’d often eat them between meals.</p>
<p>T: However, despite all that, I never stopped eating them. So in the end, they’d set aside some Candied Violets for me to eat, if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>T: Even now, my parents still occasionally send some over to me, so I often snack on them when taking a break from studying.</p>
<p>T: By the way, did you know? There are other ways that Candied Violets can be used apart from as a snack. I’d personally recommend adding them to hot milk in place of sugar.</p>
<p>T: If you do, the colour of the violets will mix in with the milk, turning its colour to a light blue. Isn’t that interesting?</p>
<p>Is there any food that you dislike, then?</p>
<p>T: Ah… that’d be Mustard.</p>
<p>T: When we were little, to test our luck, Che’nya and I would set things up so that out of five cream puffs, one would be filled with mustard. Then, we would eat one of the five puffs.</p>
<p>T: I’m sure you can imagine how things turned out. Of course, I ended up picking the one with mustard.</p>
<p>T: There wasn’t even any water nearby, and Che’nya just laughed out loud…</p>
<p>T: I was pretty much at the point of tears by the end of the whole ordeal.</p>
<p>T: But hey, let’s not talk about such bitter memories anymore, since it’s my birthday and all.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for letting me listen to your stories.</p>
<p>Once again, I wish you a happy birthday.</p>
